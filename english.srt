1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,820
All right.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,280
We both paid our enrollment
fees, so that means...

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,540
I guess our new lives here at the
Hero Academy are about to begin.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,500
Yeah!

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,850
Noir, you need to bow!

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,790
Huh?

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,220
R-Right.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,470
Is she a student, too?

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,540
You don't remember?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,020
She was there during the exams.
Maria Fianna Albert.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,980
She's the daughter of
the famous Duke Albert.

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,730
A duke... So she's one of
the highest-ranking nobles.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,870
I'll sneak a peek with my
Discerning Eye to see what she's like.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,980
Noir? Is something wrong?

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,960
There's...

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,650
There's a curse on her.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,840
A curse that will cause her to
die on her sixteenth birthday.

18
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:52,020
#03 "The Troubled Classmate"

19
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,030
A-Alice... You sure like to be close.

20
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,830
Well, today's your first day of school.

21
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,950
I know you'll do wonderfully
at the Hero Academy.

22
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,680
I don't care if I have to cough up blood!
I'm going to get into that school next year!

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,340
Th-There'll be no need to
cough up blood, but thanks.

24
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,270
Here, Brother Dearest.

25
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
A-Alice?

26
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,660
I feel that if I let you go,
you'll go somewhere far away.

27
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,900
I'm just going to school.

28
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,740
Good morning, my elite academy student!

29
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,170
It's time... for...

30
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,400
What's a father to do about this?!

31
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,200
Morning, Noir!

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,670
Morning, Emma.

33
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,680
You seem chipper this morning.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,590
Well, it's our first day of school!

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,670
My job as a librarian was whatever,
but I'm going to do my best with this!

36
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah, we're in the same S Class.

37
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,720
So, uh... Shall we do our morning greeting?

38
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,390
S-Sure.

39
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,830
This is to help stockpile your LP, too... right?

40
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,330
Noir Stardia

41
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,340
Good morning.

42
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,630
I-I'm kinda nervous.

43
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,600
Yeah...

44
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,630
We have to wear these badges that show
our ranks just for the first day of school.

45
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,630
Although the school says
your status doesn't matter...

46
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,930
G-Good morning.

47
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,150
The guy's a baronet.

48
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,830
So he's a low-class noble.

49
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,080
Guess we can ignore him.

50
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,370
Nice to meet you!

51
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm Allen, the eldest son
of the Milanos family.

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,540
I'm sure you've heard of the Milanos family.
We are trusted advisers to the king.

53
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,880
H-Hello...

54
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm Hjorth from the Boyle family!

55
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,800
Sweet! You're totally my type!

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,450
I'm Kent Proix!

57
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,770
My family ranks as the fourth-richest family!

58
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,030
She's beautiful.

59
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,040
How lovely.

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Totally different from that guy.

61
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,940
They're huge...

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,250
Everyone thinks I defeated the Dead Reaper,

63
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,250
so don't even think about
casually talking to me.

64
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,720
S-Sure.

65
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,960
Baronets are just commoners
who served the kingdom

66
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,880
and were allowed to enter noble society.

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,540
Most of the nobles don't accept us.

68
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,920
It's nice to meet you.
I'm from the Siphon family...

69
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,050
Whoops. I guess my glasses were fogged up.

70
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,560
Hello, everyone.

71
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,790
It's quite warm today, isn't it, Amane?

72
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,390
Yes. It's rather nice.

73
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,490
Miss Maria is someone
completely beyond my reach.

74
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh!

75
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,900
It's a pleasure to meet you, Noir Stardia.

76
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,740
Huh?

77
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,630
L-Lady Maria spoke to him?

78
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,880
Why? He's just a baronet!

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm honored to meet you.

80
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,400
I do hope that you'll be kind.

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,380
L-Likewise...

82
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,560
Good day to you, too, Emma Brightness.

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,820
G-G-Good day!

84
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,770
When did you become friends with Miss Maria?

85
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,060
What? That's my line!

86
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,940
Huh?

87
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,300
What's going on?

88
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,400
Miss Maria doesn't seem
like a bad person, but...

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,460
I wonder why she has a curse
that'll kill her at sixteen...

90
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,910
Let's talk some other time. Do excuse us.

91
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,500
Pardon. Please let us through.

92
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,430
Hey, maybe I misjudged you!

93
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,390
I didn't know you knew Lady Maria.

94
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm from the Siphon family. My—

95
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Not interested.

96
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,520
But I'm from the Siphon family...

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,310
I was a mercenary before I was a teacher,
from when I was 7 until I was 24.

98
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,350
The name's Elna Stongs.

99
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,620
If any of you want me to whip
you into shape, let me know.

100
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,990
I'll see you through to the end.

101
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Though I'm not letting any of you
leave until I'm satisfied.

102
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,870
She's a teacher? Are we going to be okay?

103
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,120
Outside the royal capital,

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,010
there are monsters, bandits,
and villains everywhere.

105
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,070
Depending on your luck, you could
be gone in an instant in this world.

106
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,240
So... we'll be doing some
self-defense training today.

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,150
Let's see...

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,650
Noir Stardia. Step forward.

109
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,300
Y-Yes, ma'am!

110
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,340
Come at me with that sword
as if you intend to kill me.

111
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,660
Huh? But what if I...

112
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,390
Don't worry. You won't even
be able to scratch me.

113
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,700
She's so confident.
Is she really that strong?

114
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,550
Elna Stongs Lv.232

115
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,550
Age: 24
Occupation: Academy Instructor
Skills: [Stamina Up] [Martial Arts (Grade A)]
Skills: [One-handed Swordsman] [Piercing]
Skills: [Earthen Wall] [Earthen Bullet] [Heal]

116
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,250
Sh-She's insanely strong!

117
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm only level 35!

118
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,270
Well? What are you waiting for?

119
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,480
I won't be able to hold back!

120
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,900
I have to give it my all and strike
with every ounce of my strength!

121
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,080
The Back Step. This is what
you'll be learning today.

122
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Sh-She's so fast!

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,340
Now you'll be on defense.
Try doing what I just did.

124
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,090
Th-That's probably not
as easy as you think...

125
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,540
But it is. You just draw me in,
then take a step back.

126
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,350
All right, here I come!

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,190
I-I'll be fine!

128
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,060
I've fought in a hidden dungeon
plenty of times! I've got—

129
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,190
this?!

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,020
Noir!

131
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,950
Are you okay, Noir?

132
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,950
Don't worry. I'll use Heal
to fix him right up.

133
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,320
Now we can try that one more time.

134
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,860
Sh-She's no demon instructor...

135
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,600
She's just a demon.

136
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,020
Hmm, let's see...

137
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,850
If you can successfully do a Back Step,
I'll give you a prize.

138
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,850
A prize?

139
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,910
If you manage to evade
even one of my attacks,

140
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,510
I'll do something you're sure to enjoy.

141
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,760
Fail, damn it!

142
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,830
I'm gonna get that prize!

143
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,550
I get to go next!

144
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,280
Boys are just so... pathetic.

145
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,040
I've had enough pain...

146
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,320
Maybe I can use Get Creative
to create Martial Arts C?

147
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,840
Martial Arts C

148
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,840
LP.1000

149
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,840
LP needed to Get Creative

150
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,640
Damn, that's a lot!

151
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,840
Remaining

152
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,840
LP.830

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,910
Then how about improving Back Step?

154
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,550
Improving Back Step

155
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,550
LP.200

156
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,550
LP needed to Get Creative

157
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,550
Remaining

158
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,550
LP.1630

159
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,550
Yes! This is much more cost-effective!

160
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,220
Hey, wai—

161
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,820
Don't zone out on me!

162
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,990
So the agreement was that if
I managed to use Back Step...

163
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,040
I'd get a prize from you, right, Ms. Elna?

164
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,850
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.

165
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,010
Ms. Elna.

166
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,510
She has trained as a mercenary
ever since she was young.

167
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,510
She's a cool, mature woman.

168
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,450
And her prize happened to be...

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,610
Well, how do you like that?

170
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,180
I got plenty of compliments about
my ass when I was a mercenary.

171
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,220
I can't believe he's the only one
who did a successful Back Step!

172
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,810
Hey, you actually get to enjoy that prize!

173
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,210
At least sound happier!

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,120
You're all fools.

175
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,390
Noir...

176
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,420
Go on. Tell me how you feel.

177
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,430
I-I can't breathe...

178
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,200
What? You've got the hots for me?

179
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,940
N-No, it's just... your ass is heav—

180
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,320
Excuse me?!

181
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,110
Right. Break and prize time is over.

182
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,350
Hey, how was it?

183
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,600
Was it soft? How'd it smell?

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,350
I'm so jealous.

185
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,790
I want to experience that, too...

186
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,590
Can it over there.

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Noir, are you okay?!

188
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,100
You're not going to suddenly
have a thing for butts, are you?

189
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,930
O-Of course not...

190
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,190
I definitely don't need to do that again.

191
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,170
Yet my LP went up 400.

192
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,300
I might have to ask her to sit on me again.

193
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,450
All right, time for the next lesson.

194
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,280
Divide up into pairs.

195
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,790
Noir, let's pair up!

196
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,790
Sure.

197
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,530
Hey, you two.

198
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,510
You two can't pair up.

199
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,780
What? But why?

200
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,420
You're dating, aren't you?

201
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,980
That gives you an unfair advantage.

202
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,420
No, we aren't dating, ma'am.

203
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,290
What? Really?

204
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,810
Correct. Not yet.

205
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,430
For now, we're just very close friends
who've known each other forever.

206
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,040
Well, I'm still going to say no.

207
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,400
Maria and Amane,
you two can't pair up, either.

208
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,160
You're Maria's attendant, aren't you?

209
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,610
Yes...

210
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,280
Glare at me all you want.
The answer's still no.

211
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,740
In that case, Maria...

212
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,250
Let us team up.

213
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,050
Both of our fathers are dukes.

214
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,450
Let us work together as
proud nobles of the same rank.

215
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,220
I humbly decline.

216
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,430
Wha—

217
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,690
My fellow students, it is mere luck
that I was born the daughter of a duke.

218
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,000
So I am very aware of how hard I must work
to be worthy of my status every day.

219
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,860
I truly respect baronets because,

220
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,930
despite the fact that they
were once commoners,

221
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,840
they are warriors who put their lives
on the line for this kingdom.

222
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,510
Instead of a higher noble who will
likely throw around their title,

223
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,460
I'd rather be with a sincere baronet.

224
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,670
Noir, may I have a round with you?

225
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,320
I would be absolutely honored.

226
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,220
Th-They're, uh...

227
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,990
They're getting really close!

228
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,830
Another new girl?!

229
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,600
S—

230
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,640
Sorry.

231
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,560
Right, then. Next, you'll be
practicing Passive Defense.

232
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,850
Throw your partner around
a few times, then switch.

233
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
You can throw me first.

234
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes, all right.

235
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,570
For the Passive Defense skill...

236
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,070
Skill                                                    Passive Defense

237
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,070
LP needed to Get Creative:

238
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,820
It's so cheap!

239
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,070
Maybe it's because I was always
so passive to begin with...

240
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,200
Here I go.

241
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,960
All right, that worked.

242
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,300
I-If nof whaf youf fink!

243
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,840
I-I'mf immofent fere!

244
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,410
Please don't move, Noir.

245
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,580
Huh?

246
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,950
Maria?

247
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,730
I-I'm all right. I was just a bit short of breath.

248
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,520
I told you not to push yourself.

249
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,740
Wait, is this because of her curse?

250
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,630
Rest for a while.

251
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,930
I'll come check on you
once the lesson is over.

252
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,370
Y-Yes, ma'am.

253
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,790
The Sixteenth Year Death Curse

254
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,880
causes one's entire body to be racked
with intense pain at regular intervals.

255
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,680
A curse skill that brings death
at the age of sixteen.

256
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,910
If I used Editor to remove it...

257
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,640
Sixteenth Year Death Curse

258
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,640
LP needed to Remove:

259
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,780
Crap... I don't have nearly enough.

260
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,560
Then I'll just use my Great Sage skill.

261
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,470
Answer me, Great Sage.

262
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,530
What's the most efficient way
to earn LP right now?

263
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,870
The answer is...

264
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,720
Line up all the girls here.

265
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,260
Next, run by them as your hand
touches their breasts.

266
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,110
If you're able to touch all of them,
you'll gain 2,000 LP.

267
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,850
Like I could actually do that!

268
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,950
And that's not enough LP anyway!

269
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,930
Damn it, my head hurts now!

270
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,240
B-But I have the Headache
Immunity skill... So why...

271
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,100
Noir, what's wrong? You look pale.

272
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,810
Emma... Let's do...

273
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,290
Let's do the morning greeting.

274
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,890
Huh? Right here?!
Th-That's embarrassing, though...

275
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,100
I can't hold back. Sorry!

276
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,560
That calmed it down.

277
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,110
You do realize we're in class right now?

278
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,470
I-It was an emergency...

279
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,990
Fifteen laps around the school!
You'd better get runnin', boy!

280
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,960
Yes, ma'am!

281
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,520
Hello, Lola.

282
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,250
N-N-N-N-Noir?!

283
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,810
What are you doing here at this hour?

284
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,200
I started school today.

285
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,390
You need to let me know ahead of time!

286
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,580
Give me ten... no, five minutes!

287
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,930
She's fixing her makeup.

288
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,360
She went light on it today since
she didn't think you'd show up.

289
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,640
I guess she did look a bit different.

290
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,090
But she's pretty enough without any...

291
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,710
Noir, let's ditch Cake Face and leave.

292
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,600
I can't. She's in charge of me.

293
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,030
Noir, you doofus.

294
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,860
The Sixteenth Year Death Curse...

295
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,160
A powerful curse skill that brings death.

296
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,080
And you say a duke's daughter has it?

297
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,630
People always think nobility
live such carefree lives.

298
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,630
She may not show it, but she's
probably been through a lot.

299
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,490
If we don't break the curse
in the next week, she'll...

300
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,460
Oh, no...

301
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,610
I need 8,000 LP to remove
the skill with Editor.

302
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,640
I won't be able to get that much in a week.

303
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,990
You know all about skills
and adventurers, Lola,

304
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,150
so you're the only one I can count on.

305
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,990
Isn't there anything we can do?

306
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,000
I believe there is.

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,370
If we find a cleric who can exorcise evil...

308
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,370
A cleric?

309
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,300
The cleric Luna. She's my friend,
and I trust her skills.

310
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,870
She's so popular that her schedule
is full for the next three months.

311
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,580
Noir, maybe she'll be able to help!

312
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,660
Yeah! She sounds perfect.

313
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,300
But she rarely takes on jobs
to remove curse-based skills.

314
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,140
What? Why not?

315
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
I don't know the details.

316
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,530
There may be some reason behind it,

317
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,650
but I'm her best friend,
and she won't even tell me.

318
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,870
What should we do, Noir?

319
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,920
If I can use my skills to get rid of
whatever the cleric's issue is...

320
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,910
If I don't do it, who will?

321
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,660
She helped me out back there.

322
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,380
This time, I'm going to
be the one who saves her.

323
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,140
Lola!

324
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,760
Please introduce me to this cleric.

325
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,640
Ms. Elna, are your shoulders bothering you?

326
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,630
Yes. I wonder if I can find a gentleman
anywhere who'll rub my shoulders...

327
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,900
I'll rub your shoulders if you'll sit on me again.

328
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,040
All right... if you can satisfy me, that is.

329
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,520
LP needed to Get Creative:

330
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,520
Skill                                                                  Shoulder Rub

331
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,510
Get Creative and create
the Shoulder Rub skill!

332
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,160
How's that?

333
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,080
Is this it? Is this the spot?

334
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:03,360
Y-Yes! Right there!

335
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:16,140
Meeting in progress, do not enter!

336
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,000
You're too good! Harder!

337
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,720
After that, she sat on me a bunch,
and I gained a ton of LP.

338
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,230
Next time, "The Untainted Cleric."

339
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,930
#04 "The Untainted Cleric"
